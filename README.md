      <h3>Ask&GET</h3>
      <p>
  QueryApp is a Q&A web platform I built where users can post their questions and get helpful answers â€” kind of like Brainly. I designed the front-end using HTML and CSS to keep the interface clean and user-friendly, while the back-end runs on Flask with SQLAlchemy for database management. Users can sign up, log in, ask questions, post answers, and upvote.
